## Notice: Beta

This is a newly released library. You can expect some hiccups here and there. Please report any issues you find!

## DSL

See the DSL documentation in `AshSqlite.DataLayer` for DSL documentation

## Usage

Add `ash_sqlite` to your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
{:ash_sqlite, "~> 0.1.2-rc.0"}
```

To use this data layer, you need to chage your Ecto Repo's from `use Ecto.Repo`, to `use Sqlite.Repo`. because AshSqlite adds functionality to Ecto Repos.

Then, configure each of your `Ash.Resource` resources by adding `use Ash.Resource, data_layer: AshSqlite.DataLayer` like so:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.SomeResource do
  use Ash.Resource, domain: MyDomain, data_layer: AshSqlite.DataLayer

  sqlite do
    repo MyApp.Repo
    table "table_name"
  end

  attributes do
    # ... Attribute definitions
  end
end
```

## Generating Migrations

See the documentation for `Mix.Tasks.AshSqlite.GenerateMigrations` for how to generate migrations from your resources
